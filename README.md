# Overview

There are a number of jedit plugins, macros, edit modes and other items I've developed over the years.

The goal for this project is to keep track of them and to share for any interested.

# Files

Files are directed in two separate areas:

* Home Directory
  * Mac: /Applications/jEdit.app/Contents/Java
* Settings Directory
  * mac: /Users/proth/Library/jEdit

The following are the set of files that are managed:

* Home
  * macros - automated scripts
  * modes - file edit modes
* Settings
  * abbrevs - text templates / abbreviations
  * keymaps - keyboard shortcut specifications
  * jars - plugins
